## Access and Visualisation

The Initiative for Open Ag Funding is working to secure detailed geolocation, sector classification, results and description data for investments in agricultural development and food security - published using the IATI standard.

But, if these detailed fields are not accessible in the search, browse or analysis interfaces of IATI tools, users will not be able to benefit from this additional data.

Our research has also found many donors and implementing partners are unaware of IATI: and faced with IATI tools are not sure where to start.

There is a need for:

* **Existing tools to be enhanced to work with Open Ag Funding priority fields** - offering a user-centred approach to search by sector, value-chain and sub-national location;

* **Improved visualisation tools** - designed to help answer the key questions from agriculture specialists;

* **Better marketing of tools** - and increased awareness of the information that is available to improve investments in agriculture and food security.

*"It’s also hard because you don’t really know what you don’t know. We are used to just operating on what we have and what we know. So to know if the possibilities were wide open, how would that change things, that’s difficult."* - NGO, Spring 2016 research.
