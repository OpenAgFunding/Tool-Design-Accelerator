## Organisation information

When planning agricultural investments, donors want to understand which organisations are active in a particular area, or working on a particular thematic issue. Implementing organisations want to know who good delivery partners might be, or which organisations and individuals have lessons from past projects which they can share.

In theory, IATI data could reveal this by:

* Tracking which organisations are involved in implementing activities with a particular sectoral classification;

* Tracking which organisations are involved in implementing activities in a particular geography;

* Using transaction-level data to understand the specific focus of the work each organisation is involved in.

By linking IATI data with other organisation information, donors and delivery partners could find the individuals they need to talk to in order to plan and deliver better projects. Knowing which organisations are involved in activities is also important for **aid traceability** and following the funding flows.

**However**: IATI data often lacks good organisation information. Projects like identify-org.net are working to change this by providing a better codelist of organisation identifier lists which makes it easier to look up information about aid-receiving organisations. Few tools present organisation information to users in accessible ways, leaving questions like "who is working on maize value chains in Uganda?" tricky to answer. **
