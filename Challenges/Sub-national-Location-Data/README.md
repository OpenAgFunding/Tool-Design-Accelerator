## Sub-national Location Data

It’s often not enough to know that an activity is taking place in Indonesia or in Ghana. To use data to evaluate interventions or make decisions, we need the **sub-national location.**

**With IATI it is possible** to publish where activities are, down to the nearest few metres, or to describe the administrative division where resources are targeted. These locations could be mapped to agro-ecological zones and conditions, making it possible to:

* Understand the areas, and agro-ecological zones, in receipt of funds - and those where there are funding gaps

* Understand the geographic and specialist focus of different organisations and delivery partners

* Find other organisations and funders working in particular locality, or a particular kind of area

* Co-ordinate regional value-chain investment strategies

**However,** despite strong demand for it, sub-national location data is one of the least published fields in existing IATI data. Of the 46 agencies tested in the 2016 Aid Transparency Index found, just 35.75% of IATI activities contain sub-national location data. 21 of the 46 did not publish any sub-national location information at all.

Donors and data users have paid more attention to geolocated data in recent years thanks to initiatives like AidData’s [Mapping for Results](http://aiddata.org/geocoding), and tools such as Development Gateway’s [Open Aid Geocoder](http://www.developmentgateway.org/2016/03/15/launch-open-aid-geocoder/) that are now available to assist in the process. However, these tools are add-ons, not integrated in most organisations workflows - and few activities have taken place to join the dots between the IATI location data that is available - and the wealth of geodata available on agricultural conditions and opportunities.
