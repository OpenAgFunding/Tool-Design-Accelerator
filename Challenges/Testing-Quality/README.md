## Testing Data Quality

Our consultations found that the main barrier to data use is poor data quality. When the available data is incomplete, users will find alternative sources of information -- even if this means disregarding any data which is on the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) Registry already.

The quality of available aid data continues to be a pressing issue. According to Publish What You Fund’s 2016 Aid Transparency Index, just 10 donors publish to a good or a very good standard. Whilst the Initiative for Open Ag Funding does not seek to define ‘good’, we have identified 20 ‘priority fields’, which agricultural practitioners identified as the most important. Our 20 priority fields are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Reporting Organisation</td>
    <td>Sector(s)</td>
    <td>Budget</td>
    <td>Title</td>
    <td>Related Documents</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Contact Details</td>
    <td>Metadata</td>
    <td>Contact Details</td>
    <td>Status</td>
    <td>Transactions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Transaction Classification </td>
    <td>Start & End Dates</td>
    <td>Country</td>
    <td>Sub-national Location</td>
    <td>Transaction Parties</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Transaction Traceability</td>
    <td>Results Information </td>
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>Budget</td>
    <td>Activity ID</td>
  </tr>
</table>


We know that the donors are willing to improve the quality of their data publications. However, we also know that they struggle to assessment exactly where their data is failing to meet a sufficient standard. To rectify this, we would like explore a data quality assessment tool which can:

* Provide an on-demand assessment of how well the donor is publishing the 20 priority fields before publication. This should include the ability to see which data fields are missing.

* Incorporate a means which points them towards good examples and/or guidance on how to publish better quality data.

  <tr>
    <td>Publication challenge</td>
    <td>User challenge</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Design an on-demand data quality assessment tool, which diagnoses the issues against a pre-established test. </td>
    <td>Adapt tools to better inform users about data quality and the uses to which available data can be put. Find ways to close the feedback loop between publishers and users. </td>
