# Open Ag Funding: Tool Design Challenge and Accelerator

This 4-day workshop for software development teams, organised in partnership with DFID, will offers the opportunity to:

* **Explore user needs** for agriculture-relevant aid transparency data;

* **Prototype tools** that address key gaps in the data creation and access landscape;

* **Pitch for funding and support** to develop production-ready tools over 2017;

Through this accelerator, the Open Ag Funding hopes to invest in 3 - 5 projects that will offer sustainable solutions to address one or more of the challenges posed, either through creating new tools, or integrating features into existing tools.

The data challenges can be found in the 'Challenges' folder in this repository.

# Key information

### What is the initiative for Open Ag Funding?

The [Initiative for Open Ag Funding](https://www.interaction.org/project/open-ag-funding/overview) is a partnership between [Interaction](https://www.interaction.org/), [Publish What You Fund](http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/), [Development Gateway](http://www.developmentgateway.org/), [Foundation Centre](http://foundationcenter.org/), [IFPRI](https://www.ifpri.org/) and [Open Data Services Co-operative](http://www.opendataservices.coop), funded by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Our goal is to improve the quality of data on investments for agricultural development. Based on an analysis of the data landscape, we are doing this by improving the availability of agriculture-relevant data through the **International Aid Transparency Initiative.**


Over 2016 we carried out research into existing data supply, and key user needs, and developed proposed updates to the IATI Standard. In 2017 our focus is on supporting the availability of sustainable tools for data creation and access, and on working with data publishers to produce improved data.

### How will the tool design challenge be structured?

We will confirm the final agenda based on the teams attending and conversations with you each in advance, but at an outline, it will look something like this:


* **Day 1: Exploring user needs & challenges *(10am start)***  
 We launch with a workshop at the UK Department for International Development, focussing on user needs for better data on agricultural investments. With input from country officers, researchers and agriculture specialists.

Followed by discussion sessions on key challenges, and team planning sessions.

* **Day 2: Prototype development & expert-inputs**  
  We move venue to a hackspace where teams will have space to work on developing prototypes tools or features that meet one or more of the core challenges.

We’ll be inviting selected experts on agriculture, machine learning, and application development to be on hand to provide advice and guidance at points throughout the day.

* **Day 3: Prototype and pitch development**  
 Continued working on the prototypes, and time to work up a proposal for further project funding, identifying how to go from prototype to production-ready tool or features over 2017.

* **Day 4: Prep, pitches and next steps *(till 4pm)***  
 Back at DFID to present the outcomes, and pitch to a panel from the Open Ag Funding project for resource to develop projects further.

The event is less a competition, and much more a space for us to collaborate and co-create solutions to shared problems in making IATI data effective, and agriculture-relevant.

### Who should take part?

We have invited teams with an experience of IATI and an interest in creating scaleable, sustainable products and services that can help meet the goals of the Initiative for Open Ag Funding. Ideally there will be a mix of product design, and prototype development skills.

### What’s the deal with funding?

The Initiative for Open Ag Funding has a budget allocated for tool-development over 2017, to be invested in ways that improve the availability and usability of IATI data for understanding agricultural investments.

A substantial portion of this budget will be allocated through the tool design challenge workshop.

### What about intellectual property?

You will own any intellectual property created over the period of the challenge.

We encourage you to apply an open license to anything you create.

Subsequent funding may be subject to certain open source requirements as a consequence of our funding agreement with the Gates Foundation.
